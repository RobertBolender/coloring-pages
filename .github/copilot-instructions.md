This is a React project created with Vite. The goal is to generate black-and-white coloring pages for children. The app should allow users to specify numbers, letters, and shapes to be drawn on a canvas with black outlines, set to 8.5x11 letter size for easy printing.

Ensure that the border is not visible in print mode. The canvas should be set to 8.5x11 inches in size.
